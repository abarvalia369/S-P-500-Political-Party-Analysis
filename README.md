Correlation Between Stock Market Trends and
Political Party in Office

March 2025
Research Question and Motivation

– ”How does the stock market performance change when under Demo-
cratic presidencies vs when under Republican presidencies?”

– The relationship between the performance of the stock market, and
the party that is in office, is a topic that is widely debated. This
is because it gives a very meaningful insight to the level of success
that party had during it’s term in office. The clear cut differences in
political parties lead to different sides of the debate privy that each
party can positively effect some aspect of the market. We see that it
is commonly believed that the deregulation of the Republican party
creates an environment that is favorable for a positive overall trend
of the economic business and the stock market mirrors that. While
on the other hand, some may say that the the stock market seems to
diversify and impact different sectors than usual, when the United
states in under the presidency of the Democratic Party.
– The motivation for this project is to make statistically significant
claims about the state of the stock market, differentiated by the
parties. Some examples of what we may find in the data is whether
one party may perform significantly better than the other, or maybe
some sections of the stock market do better, as well as the stability
and general bear/bull trend of the market. We are able to use data
science by analyzing this data to create a better understanding of
these perspectives of the debates.
